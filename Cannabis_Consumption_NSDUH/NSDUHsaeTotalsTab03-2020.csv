"Table 3. Marijuana Use in the Past Month: Among People Aged 12 or Older; by Age Group and State, Average Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), 2019 and 2020   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the “Total U.S.” row, 95 percent confidence intervals are based on design-based estimates. Estimated numbers in the “Total U.S.” row are aggregates of estimated numbers across all states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: The column labeled “Order” can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
