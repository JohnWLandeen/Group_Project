As of this writing, cannabis remains federally illegal as a "Schedule 1" controlled substance, reserved for drugs that have no medical benefit and a high potential for abuse (along with, for instance, heroin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)).

Proponents of decriminalizing and descheduling cannabis argue that it has been extenstively researched and scientifically validated as a plant that offers myriad physical health benefits, and with far less potential for lethal overconsumption than alcohol, for example, or even over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (and they point to the 30,000+ cannabis-related studies published on the National Center for Biotechnology's PubMed.gov site in response to claims that it has not yet been researched or studied well enough to justify recreational legalization on a national level).

The War on Drugs that began in the US in the early 1970s has painted cannabis as a "gateway drug" that utlimately leads to the use of harder substances like cocaine or heroin.  Advocates of legalization argue to the contrary, touting the potential that cannabis has as an "exit drug," which many have turned to as an alternative to geniunely addictive and harmful substances, including opioids, to reduce withdrawal symptoms and to minimize pain.

The opioid epidemic has had devastating consequences in the US, and cannabis, many theorize, is one potential contributor to its reversal.  While some studies (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246665/) have looked at the correlation between cannabis consumption and opioid misuse in a handful of states following legalization at the state level, our group project aims to compare the same data for all 50 states, to see whether the data collectively can support the above theory that cannabis legalization is a possible solution (at least in part) to our opioid problem.

Our objective is an interactive dashboard that provides users with state-specific visualizations based on datasets from reliable sources (NIH, CDC, etc.) to see whether there are answers within the data to the following questions:

1. Is there consistently a negative correlation in all / most states between reported cannabis consumption and opioid misuse/deaths?

2. In states that have legalized medical and/or recreational marijuana, has there been a greater / sharper decline in reported opioid misuse/deaths in the year(s) following legalization, compared to states that have not yet lifted restrictions?

Our datasets will include: 
- state population estimates (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/research/evaluation-estimates/2020-evaluation-estimates/2010s-state-total.html)
- A survey of self-reported cannabis consumption, once or more within the past year for ages 12 and up (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/nsduh/state-reports-NSDUH-2)
- Opioid prescribing rates per 100 people (https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/rxrate-maps/index.html)
- Opioid overdose rates (https://www.kff.org/statedata/collection/opioid-epidemic/)

We will document our processes, challenges and conclusions in full detail in the following READMEs:
- Data Collection and Cleaning (John Landeen, Albert Zeng, Janasia Roemling)
- Dataframes Construction and ERD (Albert Zeng, Jorge Jurgado, Paulal Adams)
